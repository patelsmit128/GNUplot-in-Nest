# GNUplot-in-Nest

**AIM**-Providing GNUplot plotting functionality in the Nest along with the existing Matplotlib.

**Motivation:** 
          Currently NEST uses Matplotlib to plot the graphs.There are certain limitations with the graphs generated using Matplotlib which cannot be neglected.Matplotlib wasnâ€™t designed for exploratory data analysis and visualisation.It is not the best for dealing with time series data since one needs to import all these helper classes for the year, month, week, day formatters, shared a user on a forum. It is also very unwieldy when dealing with multiple datasets while it is easy to convert dataset into a long format and plot it. Another big disadvantage is that the library is very low-level, which means that one needs to write more code to get the visualisation

**Requriment:**
            In NEST we use Matplotlib to plot various graph for the analysis purpose , so without hampering the existing functionality we have to add on another plotting capability using the gnuplot. Graphs produced using Gnuplot are better than Matplotlib in many aspects.We will generate all the generatable graphs using gnuplot. User will be given an option to select the type of graph i.e either Matplotlib or Gnuplot.requriment is not replace the matplot with GNUplot but instade of this we simply add the GNUplot functionality in Nest.so that after the perform any operation we will able to see both types of graph(graph which is generated by matplot and graphs which is generated by GNUplot).and we will use both the types of graph for different-different purposes.
